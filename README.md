# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub.....So much more to learn!!


Commit Notes:
1.) Each commit has an associated commit message with description as to why it was made.
2.) Commit Messages log the history of changes.
3.) This allows multiple people to work on the same project and know who is working on what and when.
